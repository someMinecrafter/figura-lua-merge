# Figura Lua Merge

Listens for file changes in the avatar folders and merges lua files into one script.lua. This means you can split your code into multiple files and structure your avatar, instead of having the whole code in a single file.

### WARNING: Could potentially overwrite scripts or damage your files, so use at your own risk and make sure to back up your avatars!

## How to use:

Before running the program make sure to follow these steps:

1. Back up your avatars.
2. Make sure you are **not** using the legacy file system (so make sure your avatars are inside subfolders)
3. Rename your current script.lua files to something else, I suggest main.lua, because script.lua files will be overwritten.
4. At this point you can start the program
5. Now you can add more lua files and they will all be merged into a script.lua file when changes happen
