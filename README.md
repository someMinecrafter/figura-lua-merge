# Figura Lua Merge

Listens for file changes in the avatar folders and merges lua files into one script.lua. This means you can split your code into multiple files and structure your avatar, instead of having the whole code in a single file.

**WARNING: Could potentially overwrite scripts or damage your files, so use at your own risk and make sure to back up your avatars!**
